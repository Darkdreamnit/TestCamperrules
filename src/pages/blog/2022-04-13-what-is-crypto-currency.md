description: Crypto is a new phenomenon, a way to store and transfer value
  digitally. The thing that makes crypto different from anything else we know is
  that it's almost entirely unregulated. This means that you can buy, sell, and
  trade it without oversight by anyone or any government.

Cryptography can be used for more than just securing information such as passwords and bank account numbers, it is also used for protecting emails, personal conversations, and even digital money like Bitcoin.

Cryptography involves using math to make sure only people with authorization have access to specific parts of information or communication. When someone tries to send a digital asset like Bitcoin (specifically, same with Ethereum), they are submitting special keys (digital codes) which are encrypted by computer software so that only those who have those keys can open them up and read the data they contain. They are then able to transfer it between each other without anyone else knowing what is going on. The sender only has access to their own account key which they must type in when sending ("encrypting"); the recipient gets their own account key which was sent with the transaction ("decrypting").

This way there is no way for others besides these two parties involved in any transaction tot interfere with what goes on between them because if someone else were able to see either one of their keys, not only would they be able to read all transactions from both parties but also gain access to all important information about that particular account, making both accounts much easier for hackers and thieves alike target.

## What are the use cases of crypto?

Cryptocurrency has several use cases. As a currency, it can be used for buying goods and services like you would use dollars or euros. With an increasing number of retailers accepting crypto payments, it is becoming more practical to pay for things this way.

It can also be used as a store of value. Crypto prices have been volatile but have increased over time, suggesting that they have some inherent value. In addition to being a store of value and currency, there are other use cases for crypto assets as well. For example, companies can conduct initial coin offerings to raise money from the public without having to go through venture capitalists or banks and without giving away equity in their company. Investors in these ICOs receive tokens that represent some future value in the company instead of shares that represent ownership and voting rights like they would in a traditional IPO.

## Should you get involved?

Should you get involved? Crypto currencies are highly speculative investments, and their market prices can fluctuate wildly, sometimes for no reason at all. They're also extremely risky for the average investor because they're so new (there have been less than 100 cryptocurrencies in existence as of this writing). When investing in cryptocurrencies, make sure you do your research and understand what you're getting into before going ahead with an investment.

Perhaps even more importantly, when investing in cryptocurrency, don't be taken advantage of by scammers or phishers—they will try to lure you into buying fake coins or faucets that only give out worthless tokens after paying a "fee." Do your research so you don't get scammed or tricked into buying worthless tokens.

## What is blockchain?

When you hear the word “blockchain,” you might think of a mysterious technology that sounds kinda futuristic and not quite understandable. This is true, blockchain technology is complicated. But it doesn’t need to be. The goal of this article is to explain what blockchain is so that everyday people like us can grasp its significance.

Essentially, a blockchain is a record (or ledger) of transactions that are duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each transaction in the ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system and stored in a block which then chains with all previously verified blocks, forming an unbroken chain back to the first block ever created and verified on the network (known as “the Genesis Block”).

The consensus mechanism validates two things: that each participant seeking to share data or create an event within their smart contract has adequate funds (as represented by cryptocurrency tokens or other digital assets) to pay for execution; and that they hold sufficient authority under their agreement with other participants in order to execute their query or event. Two independent mechanisms ensure that these requirements are met: one verifies that payment has been made, while another validates whether or not authority exists between participants through cryptographic validation (which we will discuss shortly).

## Proof of stake vs proof of work

You've heard the terms "proof of work" and "proof of stake," but what do they mean?

While proof of work is a cryptocurrency consensus model that ensures the security of a crypto network by making it difficult for hackers to execute their plans, proof of stake is an alternative to this model. The concept behind proof of stake is similar to that behind proof of work, except with proof-of-stake miners are chosen based on how many coins they own. In other words, if you have more bitcoin, you're more likely to mine a bitcoin block than someone who has less bitcoin. In theory, this concept makes it difficult for just one miner or group to gain control over the entire blockchain.

Though there are different variations on how exactly it works in any given application (some use a randomization algorithm while others use ownership stakes),

proof of stake is considered by some to be more secure and energy efficient than proof of work.

## Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and was released in 2009.

Bitcoin is the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency. It was released in 2009 as an open source software by Satoshi Nakamoto, the alias of a still unknown person or group of people. Bitcoin uses a distributed database to maintain a continuously growing list of transaction data (called blocks) that are verified and stored on a public ledger. The integrity and chronological order of the blockchain is enforced with cryptography.

## What is crypto mining?

Cryptocurrency mining is a lot of things. It's a multi-billion dollar, global industry that sees digital tokens awarded to those who validate the transactions at the core of this economic system. It's a way for cryptocurrency projects to distribute new coins as a reward for their efforts in securing the network, and it's how new coins are created in the first place. Crypto mining is also an extremely competitive industry that is increasingly dominated by large companies with access to cheap (and sometimes free) energy.

## The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by supply and demand.

A digital currency is a payment system that operates without the use of traditional central bodies, operating instead through its control by networked algorithms. It is a type of cryptocurrency. Central to these systems is the creation and passing on of money (e.g., bitcoins) on increasingly complex networks, so that they lose their fungibility as they are used to pay for goods and services. This creates a situation where they can no longer be considered pure forms of money, but rather property—much like stocks in a company.

Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly important because of:

* how it enables new businesses and markets to grow
* how it provides the ability for anyone with internet access to transact with others anywhere in the world
* how easy it is for anyone to participate, even through small purchases

## How can you invest in crypto currencies?

After a while, many of us realized we've been using fiat currency, with its disastrous inflation rate, to pay for all our purchases. From the moment our money hits the bank and goes into a central reserve system controlled by a handful of powerful banks, it's transformed from something that gives us power into something that conquers us. And this is especially true in the case of digital currencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin relies on decentralized computer networks to handle transactions and store data. No one person or one bank controls the network—instead, every participant has equal say-so in how it operates and what can be done with it. This decentralization makes it tough to launder money through digital currencies (the way they're designed means no bank will process your transaction). Those who have invested early in crypto are making enormous returns right now because their investments have soared in value based on demand among other investors—and because they believe Bitcoin will continue to soar thanks to increased adoption over time.

## Many people mistakenly believe that cryptocurrency is anonymous, but all transactions can be traced on blockchain.

Many people mistakenly believe that cryptocurrency is anonymous, but all transactions can be traced on the blockchain. This can lead to problems for those who use cryptocurrency to purchase illegal products such as drugs.

On the other hand, there are a few privacy coins that do offer more anonymity and privacy. These are Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH).

Most importantly though, you should consider protecting your identity while using or holding cryptocurrency by using a VPN. A VPN will encrypt your internet connection meaning no one – not even your ISP - will be able to see what websites you visit or files you download. So if you’re thinking of buying some cryptocurrency online, make sure no one is looking over your shoulder by using a VPN.

## Conclusion

In the end, it is up to you to do your research and make your own decisions about what you should invest in. It's not for everyone, but the technology behind it has tremendous potential. It’s a good idea to diversify part of your portfolio into cryptocurrencies because they are less volatile than stocks or other traditional trading systems. If you're looking for a quick way to get rich, this isn't it—but when added as part of a bigger strategy that includes more stable investments, cryptocurrencies can help increase risk-adjusted returns over time.
